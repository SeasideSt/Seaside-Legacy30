I represent a cookie, a piece of information that is stored on the client and read and writable by the server. I am basically a key/value pair of strings.
You can never trust information in a cookie, the client is free to edit it.
I model only a part of the full cookie specification.

For more information see  RFC2965 (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2965)
