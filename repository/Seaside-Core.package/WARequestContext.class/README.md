WARequestContext encapsulates all the knowledge that shuld be available while processing a single request. It does not matter if this is a request to a static file, a normal Seaside request, an AJAX request or a long Comet request.

The request context is valid only during the request that caused it. It should not be stored. Neither within instance variables, nor within the execution stack so that it might be captured by a continuation. In both cases this might lead to memory leaks.
