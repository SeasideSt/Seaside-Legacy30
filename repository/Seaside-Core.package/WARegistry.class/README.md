WARegistry maintains sessions for a Seaside application. Each session has a key, which is the _s part of Seaside URLs and is embedded in links on pages generated by Seaside. WARegistry checks requests for session keys. If one exists, the request is sent to the proper session. If not the request is a new request so handleDefaultRequest: is called so subclasses can handle the request.

Subclasses must implement the following messages:
	handleDefaultRequest:
		Handle a request without a session key, ie a new request.

Instance Variables:
	handlersByKey	<Dictionary of <session key(string),WASession>>	provides easy access to the session for a session key
	keysByHandler	<Dictionary of <WASession, session key(string)>>	provides easy access to the session key of a session
	mutex	<Semaphore>	Used to insure keysByHandler & handlersByKey are updated atomically
